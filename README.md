# The-Simon-Game
**Simon** is a classic memory game where players must repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors and sounds. Each round adds a new step to the pattern, testing the player’s concentration, memory, and reaction speed. One wrong move ends the game, making it simple to play but challenging to master.
